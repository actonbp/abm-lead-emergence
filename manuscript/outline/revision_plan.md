# Leadership Quarterly ABM Revision Plan

## Research Question
How does collective leadership emerge? Formalizing, Testing, and Integrating Process-Oriented Theories of Leadership Emergence

## Revision Strategy
1. Make the method more integrative
   - Compare concepts from different theories
   - Integrate them against each other
   - Expand beyond initial two core perspectives

2. Broaden the scope
   - Integrate approaches from other fields about leadership
   - Provide more detail about ABM framework and assumptions
   - Adopt new strategy for testing multiple models
   - Use machine learning for parameter exploration and dimension reduction

## Paper Structure

### 1. Introduction
- Collective Leadership as Core Aspect of Leadership Research
  - Historical context of "leaderless" group work
  - Process focus: How groups develop leader/follower structures
  - Current challenges in understanding emergence processes
  - Theoretical fragmentation and methodological limitations

### 2. Theoretical Framework
- Integration of multiple theoretical perspectives
- Identification of common patterns and mechanisms
- Development of testable propositions

### 3. Base Model
- Core mechanisms of leadership emergence
- Fundamental interaction patterns
- Basic assumptions and parameters

### 4. Model Extensions
- Variations incorporating different theoretical perspectives
- Additional mechanisms and contextual factors
- Parameter space exploration

### 5. Expected Outcomes
- Pattern identification and validation
- Theory integration and testing
- Machine learning for model reduction

### 6. Analysis Plan
- Pattern detection methodology
- Parameter sweep approach
- Dimension reduction strategy
- Identification of "best models"

## Next Steps
1. Literature Review and Pattern Detection
   - Collect relevant articles
   - Analyze emergence patterns
   - Identify common mechanisms
   - Create pattern taxonomy

2. Model Development
   - Design base model
   - Plan extensions
   - Define validation criteria

3. Analysis Framework
   - Develop pattern detection methods
   - Design parameter exploration strategy
   - Plan machine learning approach
