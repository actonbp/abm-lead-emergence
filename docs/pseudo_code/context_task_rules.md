# Context Effects on Task Rules

## Core Principle
- Keep perspective models unchanged
- Context modifies how task operates
- Test how each perspective naturally handles these modified tasks
- Compare which perspectives better explain emergence in each context

## Base Task Rules
Standard information-sharing task where:
```
1. Agents have information pieces
2. Sharing = leadership claim
3. Accepting = leadership grant
4. Group tries to discover truth
5. Resources and time are tracked
```

## How Contexts Modify Task Rules

### 1. High Uncertainty Context

**Task Modifications:**
```
1. Information Quality
   - More noise in information
   - Truth changes periodically
   - Multiple possible interpretations
   - Harder to verify accuracy

2. Success Criteria
   - Need multiple confirmations
   - Must track changing truth
   - Higher threshold for certainty
   - More emphasis on adaptation

3. Cost Structure
   - Verification costs added
   - Wrong answers more costly
   - Multiple attempts needed
   - Exploration encouraged
```

### 2. Resource Scarcity Context

**Task Modifications:**
```
1. Resource Management
   - Fewer total resources
   - Higher action costs
   - Failed attempts very costly
   - Conservation critical

2. Success Criteria
   - Efficiency weighted heavily
   - Must minimize waste
   - Quality still matters
   - Balance speed/accuracy

3. Cost Structure
   - High claim costs
   - Failed claims very costly
   - Successful claims save resources
   - Group sharing beneficial
```

### 3. Intergroup Threat Context

**Task Modifications:**
```
1. Time Pressure
   - Strict time limits
   - Faster decay of value
   - Speed crucial
   - Quick consensus needed

2. Success Criteria
   - Speed weighted heavily
   - Group alignment important
   - Acceptable accuracy threshold
   - Unity matters

3. Cost Structure
   - Time is main cost
   - Delay penalties
   - Quick success bonuses
   - Group coordination rewarded
```

## How Perspectives Naturally Handle Modified Tasks

### 1. Social Interactionist Perspective

**Succeeds When Task Needs:**
- Stable role structures
- Clear leader-follower dynamics
- Efficient coordination
- Consistent behavior

**Struggles When Task Needs:**
- Rapid adaptation
- Flexible roles
- Continuous learning
- Quick changes

### 2. Cognitive Perspective

**Succeeds When Task Needs:**
- Continuous learning
- Pattern recognition
- Flexible adaptation
- Error correction

**Struggles When Task Needs:**
- Quick decisions
- Resource conservation
- Stable structures
- Group unity

### 3. Identity Perspective

**Succeeds When Task Needs:**
- Group cohesion
- Unified action
- Clear boundaries
- Shared understanding

**Struggles When Task Needs:**
- Individual innovation
- Quick adaptation
- Diverse approaches
- Critical questioning

## Testing Framework

### 1. Measure Task Performance
```
For each context:
    For each perspective:
        Run multiple simulations
        Track:
            - Solution quality
            - Resource efficiency
            - Time to completion
            - Group coordination
```

### 2. Compare Leadership Emergence
```
For each context:
    For each perspective:
        Analyze:
            - How quickly leaders emerge
            - Stability of leadership
            - Effectiveness of leadership
            - Group adaptation
```

### 3. Evaluate Fit
```
For each context-perspective pair:
    Score:
        - Task performance metrics
        - Leadership emergence patterns
        - Group behavior alignment
        - Theoretical predictions
```

## Expected Patterns

### High Uncertainty Context
```
Best Fit: Cognitive
- Continuous learning works well
- Adapts to changing conditions
- Good at pattern recognition
- Flexible leadership structure

Worst Fit: Interactionist
- Too rigid once roles set
- Slow to adapt to changes
- May maintain wrong leaders
- Inflexible structure
```

### Resource Scarcity Context
```
Best Fit: Interactionist
- Stable roles save resources
- Clear structure reduces waste
- Efficient coordination
- Predictable behavior

Worst Fit: Cognitive
- Learning costs resources
- Too much exploration
- Constant adaptation costly
- Less efficient structure
```

### Intergroup Threat Context
```
Best Fit: Identity
- Quick group alignment
- Strong coordination
- Clear direction
- Unified action

Worst Fit: Cognitive
- Too slow to learn
- Too much individual focus
- Less group cohesion
- Slower consensus
```
