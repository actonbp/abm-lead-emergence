# Leadership Effects Across Contexts

## Core Leadership Effects

### What Makes Someone a Leader?
1. **Beyond Just Claiming**
   - Not just about sharing information
   - Must build up "leader identity" through:
     * Successful information sharing
     * Being granted leadership by others
     * Consistent positive contributions
     * Building trust over time

2. **Leader Identity Development**
   - Starts at neutral (50)
   - Increases with:
     * Successful leadership claims
     * Quality of shared information
     * Group acceptance
   - Decreases with:
     * Failed claims
     * Sharing poor information
     * Group rejection

### Leadership Benefits
When someone has high leader identity:

1. **Direct Benefits**
   - Lower resource cost when sharing (-50%)
   - Higher acceptance probability
   - More influence on group understanding
   - Can share information more frequently

2. **Group Benefits**
   - Faster convergence to solution
   - More efficient resource use
   - Better filtering of bad information
   - Clearer direction for group

## Context-Specific Leadership Effects

### 1. High Uncertainty Context
When there's lots of uncertainty about what's true:

**Leader Effects:**
- Leaders help filter noise from signal
- Their information is weighted more heavily
- They can "anchor" group understanding
- Failed leadership more costly (group needs stability)

**Example:**
```
Normal Context:
- Share info → 50% weight in group understanding
- Failed claim → -5 resource cost

High Uncertainty:
- Leader shares → 80% weight in understanding
- Leader fails → -10 resource cost
```

### 2. Intergroup Threat Context
When competing with other groups or under pressure:

**Leader Effects:**
- Leaders speed up decision-making
- Their direction reduces wasted effort
- Group cohesion increases
- Time efficiency becomes critical

**Example:**
```
Normal Context:
- Each share takes 1 time unit
- Group moves at normal pace

Threat Context:
- Leader shares take 0.5 time units
- Group moves 50% faster with leader
```

### 3. Resource Scarcity Context
When resources (time/energy) are limited:

**Leader Effects:**
- Leaders are much more efficient
- Failed claims more punishing
- Group must be more selective
- Conservation becomes priority

**Example:**
```
Normal Context:
- Share cost = 5 resources
- Failed share = -3 resources

Scarcity Context:
- Leader share = 2 resources
- Failed share = -8 resources
```

## How Leadership Identity Changes Task Dynamics

### 1. Information Flow
**Without Strong Leader:**
- Everyone shares equally
- All information weighted similarly
- More resources spent
- Slower progress

**With Strong Leader:**
- Leader shares more frequently
- Their information trusted more
- Resources used efficiently
- Faster progress

### 2. Decision Making
**Without Strong Leader:**
- More trial and error
- Equal voice in decisions
- Slower convergence
- More resource waste

**With Strong Leader:**
- More directed exploration
- Leader guides direction
- Faster convergence
- Efficient resource use

### 3. Group Behavior
**Without Strong Leader:**
- More democratic
- Higher uncertainty
- More experimentation
- Equal participation

**With Strong Leader:**
- More hierarchical
- Clearer direction
- Focused effort
- Coordinated action

## Leadership Thresholds

### Becoming a Recognized Leader
- Must achieve leader identity > 75
- Requires consistent successful claims
- Need group acceptance
- Context affects threshold:
  * High Uncertainty: Higher threshold (80)
  * Threat: Lower threshold (70)
  * Scarcity: Much higher threshold (85)

### Maintaining Leadership
- Must maintain performance
- Can lose status if:
  * Too many failed claims
  * Share poor information
  * Better leader emerges
- Context affects maintenance:
  * High Uncertainty: Harder to maintain
  * Threat: Easier to maintain
  * Scarcity: Much harder to maintain

## Implementation Example

### Normal Context
```
If agent.leader_identity > 75:
  - Resource costs reduced 50%
  - Information weight increased 25%
  - Time costs reduced 25%
```

### High Uncertainty
```
If agent.leader_identity > 80:
  - Resource costs reduced 30%
  - Information weight increased 50%
  - Time costs reduced 20%
```

### Threat Context
```
If agent.leader_identity > 70:
  - Resource costs reduced 40%
  - Information weight increased 20%
  - Time costs reduced 50%
```

### Scarcity Context
```
If agent.leader_identity > 85:
  - Resource costs reduced 70%
  - Information weight increased 20%
  - Time costs reduced 30%
```
