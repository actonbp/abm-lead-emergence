## Expected Patterns

### 1. Stage Progression
```
Should see:
- Stages complete sequentially
- Quality improves within each stage
- Leaders emerge for each stage
- Clear stage transitions
```

### 2. Resource Management
```
Expected pattern:
- Resources decrease over time
- Leaders use resources more efficiently
- Failed claims cost less
- Resource use affects behavior
```

### 3. Time Management
```
Should observe:
- Time accumulates with actions
- Leaders act more quickly
- Stage completion times vary
- Overall progress reasonable
```

### 4. Information Flow
```
Should see:
- Information shared within stages
- Quality improves over time
- Leaders emerge from good sharing
- Clear stage completion criteria
```

## Success Criteria

### 1. Stage Mechanics
- Stages complete in order
- Quality improves within stages
- Leaders emerge naturally
- Clear stage transitions

### 2. Resource Mechanics
- Resource usage makes sense
- Leadership efficiency visible
- Failed claims less costly
- No resource depletion

### 3. Time Mechanics
- Time accumulation logical
- Leadership speed bonus works
- Stage timing reasonable
- Overall completion possible

### 4. Information Mechanics
- Information flows properly
- Quality improves logically
- Leadership emerges from sharing
- Stage completion works

## Next Steps If Successful
1. Test with different parameters
2. Add contexts
3. Compare perspectives

## Next Steps If Issues
1. Debug stage progression
2. Adjust resource mechanics
3. Fix timing issues
4. Improve information flow
