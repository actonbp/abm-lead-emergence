# Theoretical Predictions Across Contexts

## High Uncertainty Context

### Context Characteristics
- Truth/solution keeps changing
- Information is noisy
- Multiple valid interpretations
- Need for continuous adaptation

### 1. Cognitive Perspective
**Should Succeed Because:**
```
Theoretical Mechanisms:
- Learning from observation
- Continuous schema updating
- Pattern recognition focus
- Flexible leadership structure

Expected Data Patterns:
1. Leadership Emergence
   - Multiple leaders over time
   - Leadership shifts with changing conditions
   - Smooth transitions between leaders
   - High leader turnover

2. Group Performance
   - Steady improvement in accuracy
   - Good error detection/correction
   - Flexible response to changes
   - Higher long-term performance

3. Group Dynamics
   - Distributed influence
   - Active information sharing
   - High exploration
   - Dynamic role switching
```

**Real World Example:**
Like a research team exploring new territory - leadership shifts based on who best understands current challenges.

### 2. Social Interactionist Perspective
**Should Struggle Because:**
```
Theoretical Limitations:
- Rigid identity formation
- Stable role expectations
- Resistance to role changes
- Path-dependent leadership

Expected Data Patterns:
1. Leadership Emergence
   - Early leader lock-in
   - Resistant to leadership changes

   - Role rigidity

2. Group Performance
   - Initial success but fails to adapt
   - Decreasing performance over time
   - Missed adaptation opportunities
   - Rigid response patterns

3. Group Dynamics
   - Fixed hierarchies
   - Reduced information sharing
   - Low exploration
   - Resistance to change
```

**Real World Example:**
Like a traditional team stuck with outdated practices when the market changes rapidly.

### 3. Identity Perspective
**Mixed Performance Because:**
```
Theoretical Trade-offs:
- Strong group alignment helps coordination
- But consensus focus limits adaptation
- Clear structure but too stable
- Group cohesion vs. needed flexibility

Expected Data Patterns:
1. Leadership Emergence
   - Strong initial consensus
   - Clear but inflexible structure
   - Group-level resistance to change
   - Slow adaptation

2. Group Performance
   - Good early coordination
   - Struggles with major changes
   - Group-think problems
   - Moderate overall performance

3. Group Dynamics
   - High cohesion
   - Limited diversity
   - Strong alignment
   - Slow to change
```

## Resource Scarcity Context

### Context Characteristics

- Stable relationships
- Efficient coordination
- Predictable behavior

Expected Data Patterns:
1. Leadership Emergence
   - Quick, stable leadership
   - Clear hierarchy
   - Efficient role division
   - Low leadership contests

2. Group Performance
   - High resource efficiency
   - Consistent performance
   - Low waste
   - Steady improvement

3. Group Dynamics
   - Clear structure
   - Efficient coordination
   - Minimal conflicts
   - Resource conservation
```

**Real World Example:**
Like a well-oiled startup team operating on a tight budget.

### 2. Cognitive Perspective
**Should Struggle Because:**
```
Theoretical Limitations:
- Learning costs resources
- Exploration is expensive
- Continuous adaptation drains energy
- Trial and error costly

Expected Data Patterns:
1. Leadership Emergence
   - Costly leadership contests
   - Resource-draining exploration
   - Inefficient transitions
   - Unstable structure

2. Group Performance
   - High resource consumption
   - Inconsistent results
   - Costly mistakes
   - Resource depletion

3. Group Dynamics
   - Expensive learning
   - Wasteful exploration
   - Resource conflicts
   - Inefficient adaptation
```

### 3. Identity Perspective
**Should Perform Well Because:**
```
Theoretical Strengths:
- Group-level resource management
- Shared conservation norms
- Efficient coordination
- Clear boundaries

Expected Data Patterns:
1. Leadership Emergence
   - Resource-efficient leadership
   - Group-focused conservation
   - Clear resource allocation
   - Stable structure

2. Group Performance
   - Good resource management
   - Consistent efficiency
   - Group-level conservation
   - Sustainable performance

3. Group Dynamics
   - Strong coordination
   - Clear norms
   - Efficient sharing
   - Group-focused saving
```

## Intergroup Threat Context

### Context Characteristics
- Time pressure
- Need for quick action
- External competition
- Unity important

### 1. Identity Perspective
**Should Succeed Because:**
```
Theoretical Mechanisms:
- Strong group identity
- Quick alignment
- Clear boundaries
- Unified action

1. Leadership Emergence
   - Rapid leader acceptance
   - Strong group support
   - Clear direction
   - High stability

2. Group Performance
   - Quick coordination
   - Fast decision-making
   - United response
   - Effective competition

3. Group Dynamics
   - High cohesion
   - Strong alignment
   - Clear boundaries
   - Unified purpose
```

**Real World Example:**
Like a sports team in a championship game.

### 2. Cognitive Perspective

- Learning takes time
- Individual focus
- Complex processing
- Slow adaptation

Expected Data Patterns:
1. Leadership Emergence
   - Slow leader selection
   - Weak coordination
   - Unclear direction
   - Poor timing

- Clear roles help quick action
- But role negotiation takes time
- Stable structure but slow to form
- Good coordination once established

Expected Data Patterns:
1. Leadership Emergence
   - Initial role confusion
   - Eventually clear structure
   - Moderate response speed
   - Stable but slow to form
