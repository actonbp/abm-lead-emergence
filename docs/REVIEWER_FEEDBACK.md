# Reviewer Feedback Summary

## Editor's Overview

The paper requires major revisions to address several key areas:

1. **Model Clarity**
   - ABMs can become complex systems to understand
   - Need more detail on model conceptualization
   - Clearer justification for specific decisions
   - Better specification of confirming/falsifying predictions

2. **Theoretical Framework**
   - Streamline introduction of theoretical perspectives
   - Clarify distinct contributions of each framework
   - Reduce conceptual overlap
   - Delineate competing predictions

3. **Interdisciplinary Accessibility**
   - Better contextualize core leadership concepts
   - Define key terms for broader audience
   - Include cross-disciplinary references
   - Improve overall accessibility

## Detailed Reviewer Feedback

### Reviewer 1: Model Implementation & Comparison

#### Strengths
- Interesting approach to formalizing theoretical claims
- Good potential for advancing understanding
- Well-justified rules and propositions

#### Key Issues
1. **Model Documentation**
   - Insufficient technical detail
   - Missing sample sizes
   - Lack of robustness tests
   - Unclear parameter justifications
   - Errors in model tables

2. **Theory Comparison**
   - Running separate models may not be optimal
   - Need for nested model comparisons
   - Better identification of core theoretical differences
   - Clearer distinction between concepts

#### Suggestions
- Test theories competitively in nested models
- Identify core differences between theories
- Generate alternative predictions
- Test with empirical data

### Reviewer 2: Theoretical Framework & Context

#### Key Issues
1. **Theoretical Clarity**
   - Lengthy descriptions without clear delineation
   - Fuzzy concepts need better definition
   - Overlapping propositions between frameworks

2. **Contextual Factors**
   - Missing important contextual elements
   - Need to consider:
     - Group size effects
     - Coordination challenges
     - Task expertise relevance
     - Environmental factors

#### Suggestions
- Include passive leadership emergence
- Consider social network analysis tools
- Better specify leadership structure schemas
- Address context sensitivity

### Reviewer 3: Interdisciplinary Integration

#### Strengths
- Comprehensive review of leadership perspectives
- Innovative use of ABM approach
- Good operationalization of theories

#### Key Issues
1. **Definition & Context**
   - Need early definition of key terms
   - Better historical context needed
   - More specific organizational context
   - Clearer empirical grounding

2. **Literature Integration**
   - Include anthropological perspectives
   - Consider evolutionary aspects
   - Add social psychology research
   - Reference broader leadership studies
