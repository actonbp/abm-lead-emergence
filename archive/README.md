# Archive Directory

This directory contains previous implementations and experimental features that are no longer part of the active codebase but are maintained for reference.

## Contents

### Models (`models/`)

1. **Schema Model** (`schema_model.py`)
   - Early implementation focusing on schema-based leadership emergence
   - Used ILTs (Implicit Leadership Theories) as primary mechanism
   - Replaced by more flexible base model with contexts

2. **Network Model** (`network_model.py`)
   - Experimental implementation with network effects
   - Included interaction networks and influence spread
   - Features may be reintegrated in future versions

3. **Schema Network Model** (`schema_network_model.py`)
   - Combined approach using both schemas and networks
   - Experimental integration of multiple mechanisms
   - Provided insights for current modular design

### Scripts (`scripts/`)

1. **Feature Analysis** (`run_feature_analysis.py`)
   - Early analysis approach using feature extraction
   - Focused on temporal patterns in leadership emergence
   - Replaced by current metrics-based analysis

2. **Parameter Exploration** (`run_parameter_exploration.py`)
   - Initial parameter space exploration
   - Used different optimization strategies
   - Superseded by current parameter sweep framework

## Purpose

This archive serves several purposes:
1. Maintains historical record of development
2. Provides reference implementations
3. Documents evolution of project approach
4. Preserves code for potential future use

## Usage

While these files are not actively maintained:
1. They may contain useful implementations
2. Can provide insights for new features
3. Serve as examples of alternative approaches

## Note

If reusing code from these files:
1. Review thoroughly before integration
2. Update to current project standards
3. Add appropriate tests
4. Document any adaptations
